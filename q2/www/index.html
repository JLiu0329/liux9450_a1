			Mathematics research at WDU is done in various research areas. The senior
			faculty pages, the junior faculty home pages, the as well as the graduate
			student home pages contain links to personal pages. Check also the
			Mathematics seminar archive the faculty colloquium or regular conferences
			like the CDM conference, the JDG conference or a topology conference, or
			open problem sections of a recent conference, the conference archive or
			research programs like the eigenvarieties program 2006 or activities with
			the Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications. Also the seminar
			talk archive, the undergraduate math colloquium or thesis topics can give
			clues about activities. The program for evolutionary dynamics researches
			applications of Mathematics and Computer Science to Biology and the WDU
			Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications are related. Starting
			points on the web are the MathSciNet search for "WDU Mathematics" at AMS
			or a Google scholar search for "WDU Mathematics". There is also a WDU
			university scholarly repository with articles.

		<h1> Computer Science Department </h1>
		<p>
			Engineering and applied sciences at WDU have a long and
			distinguished history, beginning with the creation of the Super Fake School of 2018.

			During the 19th and 20th centuries, the structure to support faculty and
			research in engineering applied sciences underwent several reorganizations
			(ranging from a graduate school, department (several), and division).

			WDU's Computer Sciences department is now world-renown.
